I encountered the following problems:
 - CORS-ERROR (issue for backend)
 - Now you can not control web app, so you should install following extension for Google Chrome
 - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cross-domain-cors/mjhpgnbimicffchbodmgfnemoghjakai
 - vercel has a problem with reactjs. If you reload the page when you are on a certain route, it will issue a 404 error
 - I had a ready solution to this problem if the project could be built with nextjs
 - But since I don't have a ready-made solution for reactjs, this issue remains open for now
